# RECAP Template : R - Large 

## Purpose

This repository is a [RECAP](https://recap-org.github.io) template for academic data projects with R. It is designed to run in cloud IDEs (e.g., GitHub Codespaces) and local IDEs (VS Code, RStudio).Key features:

- A clear workflow that converts raw data into processed data, analyses processed data into figures and tables, and uses those assets in LaTeX documents (article, appendix, presentation).
- Built-in practices for reproducible research: dependency management ([renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)), automated build pipelines ([Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html)), and testing ([testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/)).
- A containerized, reproducible software environment that allows running this template on the browser.
- Documentation and tutorials (see the [RECAP](https://recap-org.github.io) site) to help you get started and teach collaborators.

The building blocks of this template are:

1. Clean raw data to produce processed data
2. Analyse the processed data to produce tables and figures
3. Use the tables and figures in a series of LaTeX documents: the research article, a separate appendix, and a Beamer presentation. 

These three steps are orchestrated using Make, which ensures that each step is only re-executed when necessary.

## Getting started

To get started, above the file list, click **Use this template**.

![Use this template button](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-76823/mw-1440/images/help/repository/use-this-template-button.webp)

You have two options: 

### Try it out online

1. Select **Open in a codespace**. 
2. Wait for the codespace to be created and started. **This may take up to 20 minutes.** ☕
3. Once the codespace is ready, you can follow the instructions in the **Basic demo** section below.

### Make your own copy

1. Select **Create a new repository**.
2. Once it is ready, you can: 
    - Open it in GitHub Codespaces by clicking the green **Code** button and selecting **Open with Codespaces > New codespace**.
    - Clone it to your local machine use it locally. You can use the provided containerized environment for a one-click install of all the dependencies (documentation for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and for Positron)

## Demo

First, install the R packages used in this template. Open an R console and type:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "modelsummary", "testthat"))
```

Open a terminal in your IDE and type:

```bash
make
```

This will run the data cleaning script, then do the analysis, and finally compile all the LaTeX documents. You will find the final documents in the `./bin/tex` directory and intermediary reports of the data cleaning and analysis steps in the `./bin/src` directory.

Run the tests by opening a terminal and typing: 

```bash
make tests
```

### From data cleaning to document production

When running the command `make all` in the terminal, this template uses GNU make to execute three steps: 

1. **Clean raw data.** Run all the scripts in the `./src/data` directory
2. **Do the analysis.** Run all the scripts in the `./src/analysis` directory
3. **Compile the LaTeX documents.** Build all the documents in the `./tex` directory

You can customize `./Makefile` to change how the build steps are executed. 

#### Step 1: cleaning raw data

The raw data should be placed in the `./data/raw` directory, and committed to git (unless it is very large, in which case you should consider alternative storage solutions). 

The code that processes that data into raw data should be a series of Quarto `.qmd` scripts placed in the `./src/data` directory. Each script should produce a series of clean datasets, to be placed in the `./data/processed` directory. Each script should be able to run in parallel (i.e., they should not depend on previous scripts). 

Using Quarto has a series of advantages. First, it always produces a single, traceable `.pdf` output that can be used for build scripts. Second, Quarto provides easy to read output. Third, Quarto has a cache feature that can dramatically speed up code re-execution. 

#### Step 2: doing the analysis

The code that does the analysis uses the processed data to procude tables and figures used in the LaTeX documents. This code should be a series of Quarto `.qmd` scripts placed in the `./src/analysis` directory. Each script takes the processed data in `./data/processed` as inputs, and stores its outputs in `./assets/tables` and `./assets/figures`. This template provides the helper functions `save_figure` and `save_table` that do this for you. These functions are in `./src/lib/io.R`. 

#### Step 3: compiling the LaTeX documents

Each LaTeX document is a sub-directory of `./tex`. The main `.tex` file of each document must be called `main.tex`. Each LaTeX document has symlinks to the `./assets` directory and to `./library.bib` for shared use of the project's assets and bibliography. 

A project may also use assets that are not generated by code (e.g., external images, ...). These should be placed in `./assets/static` and committed to git. 

### Helper functions

Helper functions are shared across your data and analysis code. They are declared in `.R` files that are placed in `./src/lib`. Think of these helper functions as a quasi-R package that accompanies the project. As such, each of these functions should be properly documented so that all collaborators understand how they work.  

### Tests

Tests are placed in the `./tests` directory. They should be files called `test-NAME.R`, with `NAME` a friendly name for your series of tests. 

You should specify tests to ensure that the raw data has been properly cleaned and that the helper functions work as intended. 

### Configuration

Look into the following files to tweak things as you see fit: 

- `./.lintr`: R linting options
- `./_quarto.yaml`: Quarto options
